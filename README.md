# Cookie Clicker Source Code (v2.031)
As the title says, this is the Cookie Clicker Source Code, updated to v2.031

As long as github.com isn't blocked on your schools WiFi, you should be able to play this.

By the way, this isn't really source code, I pulled the entire website using Wget, and then I uploaded the files here. Then I setup a GitHub Page Website and when you go to that website, it's unblocked Cookie Clicker. Again, If GitHub isn't blocked, this isn't.
